		\item Ruby was developed in the mid 1990s but made its first appearance in 1995. It is an interpreted high-level language. Yukihiro wanted an object-oriented scripting language that he liked and was not to complex ,he had tried Perl and Python and did not like it so he decided to make his own.
		\item The name Ruby was proposed before any code had been written for the project. It was the birthstone of one of his colleagues. By 2000 Ruby was more popular than Python in Japan. Yukihiroâ€™s initial aim of Ruby was just to design a good a language that he enjoyed and others can enjoy and reducing the programming work. Ruby is primarily for building web applications , but Python is easier to learn because it is explicit and faster.
