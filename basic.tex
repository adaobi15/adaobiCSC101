\item John  G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz released the original version in May 1st 1964. BASIC is a high-level programming language. They developed this less complex programming language which enables students in fields of science and mathematics to work with the use of computers. They also developed Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) which allowed users to modify and run BASIC schemes at the same time. Basic is mostly used for business applications .They initial tried to develop programs like DOPE ( Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming experiment) and DARSIMCO (Dartmouth simplified code ) but they weren’t too successful. The project was gifted a $300,000 grant  from the National Science Foundation which they were able to use to purchase GE-225 process control computer.
